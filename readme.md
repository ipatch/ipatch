## TODOs (no particular order) ...mostly gripes

testing formula using `brew install` is **maddening**, why?

- verifying the checksum for an already downloaded tarball takes a **considerable** amount of time.
- not being able to use the existing cmake build dirs with the `--keep-tmp` arg provided by brew is **maddening** as well.

- [ ] hack homebrew's brew command to use my existing build cache dirs for cmake projects
- [ ] for the love god, find a way to speed up / disable the verification of homebrew checksum process
- [ ] brew __just is__ **slow** to launch period on my 4th gen i7 😭

the struggle is real
